   - Upload all files in the `Website` folder to your hosting root directory

2. **Configure database connection:**
   - Edit `includes/config.php` with your database credentials:
     ```php
     $db_host = 'localhost';    // Your database host
     $db_name = 'your_db_name'; // Your database name
     $db_user = 'your_db_user'; // Your database username
     $db_pass = 'your_db_pass'; // Your database password
     ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Visit `https://your-domain.com/setup_database.php` in your browser
   - This script will create all the necessary tables
   - You can add sample data by clicking the "Add Sample Data" button

4. **Update email API configuration:**
   - Edit the email API URL and key in `includes/config.php`:

     ```

6. **Configure API access for camera integration:**
   - Edit `api/add_violation.php` to set your camera API key:

4. Generate reports and track payment status

### For Camera Integration
To add a new violation from your camera system, make an API call:
